<h1>Hello I am Rhys Davies</h1> 
I am a Senior at Ohio Northern University in Ada, Ohio. <br />
I am currently majoring in Electrical Engineering with a minor in computer science <br />
And I am the programming team leader for the ONU Polar Robotics Robotic football organization <br />

I have interests in microcontrollers, the Arduino Uno R3 and the ESP32 Devkit Models <br />
Recently I have been getting into writing driver software to interact with the hardware timers in the ESP32 <br />
I also have plans to poke around with the bluetooth drivers as well! <br />

Welcome to my GitHub, I post some personal projects and maybe some projects I work on with other students <br />
