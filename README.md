<h1>Hello I am Rhys Davies</h1> 
I am a freshman at Ohio Northern University in Ada, Ohio. <br />
I am currently majoring in Electrical Engineering with a minor in computer science. <br />
Welcome to my GitHub, I post some personal projects and maybe some projects I work on with other students. <br />
Last semester we learned C++ up until we were introduced to Object Oriented Programming at the end of the semester. <br />
This semester I am currently learning Java, it's pretty fun :)
